## What is this?

This is Guru Meditations's entry to the ICFP 2012 Contest.

## Who are you?

## How did you do this?

We are big fans of the object-functional language Scala, and that's what we used for coding. We also used SBT, Emacs, Ensime and IntelliJ.

## What was your score?

We actually never submitted :-) We ended the contest with the following scores, but we thought they were not good enough even for a modest classification. However, judging from IRC and Twitter reactions, we might have been wrong:

```
Map1:
Map2:
...
```

## Ok... so... why did you released the code?

Two reasons. First, the number of Scala entries are two low. Opening the code *might* attract more people to use the language.

The second reason is because we think the Pattern Matching algorithm we used in the simulator is cool. We know there are lots of ways to enhance it, including the design of an external DSL to capture the patterns more "graphically", and it's probably slower when compared to an in-place, mutable, switch-case based C implementation... but it's still cool :-)

## Could you talk a little on your solving strategy?
